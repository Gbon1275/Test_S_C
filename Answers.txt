I would run this in aws lambda as a function. Python is supported and its easy to deploy, also cost metering and scalability
would be of benifit however i would not think that automation like this would not be the best way forward in the future.
Simple Message Queue:
    We need something to hold the messages for the other services to pick up and action.
AWS Lambda Function:
    this would be for holding the code and executing the task when required.
S3 Bucket:
    this was the stated upload destination for clients.
some trigger:
    if all of these files arrived together i was say that would be the best trigger or a cron job for every so often

I would further import this by adding aging to the function for managing the CSV's also a been touched logic to know
that the function is not rehashing old information. further I would improve error handling and reporting as i feel that
this implementation is fine for a POC but not for a production system. I think I would also see if there is not a better
way to do this in the future so that this automation could be removed maybe a module or api that allows customers to post
there messages by themselves in the future.

Apart from being rushed for time this was one of the better coding challenges I have seen and I really enjoyed working
on it.

Happy Holidays.
